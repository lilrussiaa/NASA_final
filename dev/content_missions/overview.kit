        <li>
            <p>Demonstrate new technologies, capabilities, and business approaches needed for future exploration
                including Mars </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Study the Moon to learn more about the origin and history Earth, the Moon, and our solar system </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Establish American leadership and a strategic presence on the Moon while expanding our U.S. global
                economic impact </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Broaden our commercial and international partnerships </p>

    <h3><strong>How Do We Get There? </strong></h3>
    <p><strong>
            NASA's powerful new rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS),
            set to launch from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,
            FL, will send astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft nearly a
            quarter-million miles from Earth to lunar orbit. Astronauts will
            dock Orion at the Gateway and transfer to a human landing system
            for expeditions to the surface of the Moon. They will return to
            the orbital outpost to board Orion again before returning safely to Earth. </strong></p>

    <h3>When will we get there?</h3>
    <p>Starting in 2022, and throughout the decade, we will send a suite of science
        instruments and technology demonstrations to the lunar surface through commercial
        lunar payload deliveries. </p>
    <p>Prior to a lunar surface landing, we will fly two missions around the Moon to test
        our deep space exploration systems. We're working toward launching Artemis I,
        an uncrewed flight to test the SLS and Orion spacecraft together, followed by
        the Artemis II mission, the first SLS and Orion flight test with crew.</p>
