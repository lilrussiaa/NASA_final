            Rollout is the first time the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft
            will make their way to the launch pad ahead of Wet Dress Rehearsal,
            which is the final test of the integrated system before launch and will
            be conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The rehearsal will run the Artemis I launch
            team through operations to load propellant into the rocket's tanks and conduct a full launch countdow

            will launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida
            and travel to the International Space Station. Once aboard
            the orbiting laboratory, the four-person Axiom Space crew
            will conduct science, outreach, and commercial activities
            for eight days before their return to Earth.
