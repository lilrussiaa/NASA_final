            Artemis is the first step in the next era of human exploration.
            Together with commercial and international partners,
            NASA will establish a sustainable presence on the Moon to prepare for missions to Mars.

        With Artemis missions, NASA will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon,
        using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.
        We will collaborate with our commercial and international partners to establish the
        first long-term human-robotic presence on and around the Moon.
        Then, we will use what we learn on and at the Moon to take the next giant leap:
        sending the first astronauts to Mars.
